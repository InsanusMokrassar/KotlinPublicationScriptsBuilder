This application was created to decrease routine in process of project creating. Currently this tool can:

* Create `publish.gradle` file with
    * Customizable project name and description
    * Autoloading and filling license info
    * Optional GPG signing
    * Opportunity to automatically include `MavenCentral` (Sonatype) repository as target repo
    * Include different developers with their nicknames and e-mails
* Create configuration file with extension `kpsb` to be able to reconfigure publication in future via this app and simply update after new versions of application will be created
